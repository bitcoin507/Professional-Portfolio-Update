## Intro

For this assignment I have refactored my Portfolio page into a React app.I have created seperate sections for my resume, homepage,contact,about,projects and footer.

I really like using React because I can see updates in realtime without the hasstle of restarting everytime.

The name of the application is called Captain Crypto's Professional Portfolio . It has links to my resume, LinkedIn profile and contact info It also has links to 3 deployed apps.

Here is a link to the deployed app:
